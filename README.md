Title: Nifty Bank Index Price Forecasting with AR(2) Model

Description:
This project focuses on predicting Nifty Bank Index prices using an autoregressive model (AR(2)). The Nifty Bank Index reflects the performance of the banking sector in the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). The project includes data analysis, model construction, and evaluation of predictive performance.

Key Components:

Introduction: Provides background information on the Nifty Bank Index and its significance in the Indian stock market.
Descriptive Statistics: Presents summary statistics and tests for normality of the returns data.
Correlation Analysis: Examines the correlation between current returns and lagged returns.
Autoregressive Model (AR(2)): Defines the AR(2) model, specifies coefficients, and evaluates model performance.
Normality Test for Errors: Conducts tests to assess the normality of errors from the model.
Heteroscedasticity Test: Tests for heteroscedasticity in the model's residuals.
Multicollinearity Test: Assesses multicollinearity among variables in the model.
Conclusion: Summarizes findings and discusses the effectiveness of the AR(2) model for predicting Nifty Bank Index prices.
This project provides insights into the predictability of Nifty Bank Index prices and potential avenues for further research.
